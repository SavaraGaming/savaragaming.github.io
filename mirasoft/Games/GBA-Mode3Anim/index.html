			<b>Concept:</b><br />
			This project is meant to demonstrate the difficulties associated with animating on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Making large changes per frame quickly results in slowdown. Thus, the goal becomes optimizing as much as possible while remaining compelling. I chose to work around the limiting hardware by introducing a few elements that didn't compromise drawing time. I started by adding dynamics: my initials bounce in place with acceleration. Then, I modified the colors of each letter based on their dynamics and phase-shifted by letter. This caused a wave of color to roll over the letters are the same time in every bounce. These types of tricks are interesting and sacrifice little rendering time.
