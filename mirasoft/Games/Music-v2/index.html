				Play the Original Prototype<br />

			<br />
			
			<b>Controls:</b><br />
			Left Mouse: Shoot
			<br /><br />

			<b>Concept:</b><br />
			The theme of this prototype was "Music Games."  I chose to focus on the music, making it the centerpiece of the prototype.  The music communicates with the gameplay through the visual experience alone.  In this respect, the prototype is similar to an amusement park ride, where participation in the experience is mostly passive.  The player "lets" the experience come to them.  The shooting mechanic ends up being something to keep the player busy or to challenge themselves, which itself has coincidentally been used as a technique in real amusement park rides.<br /><br />

			The revision focused on improving what was already there in the original.  The game now keeps track of the player's "score" as they hit ice creams.  It is also intended to be a slight surprise that the disco balls kept count of your hits, like a little wink at your playing habits.<br /><br />

			I hand-placed disco balls all over the place and made some of them fly around (strategically placed to prevent boredom, hopefully).  I added a moving cube field in one spot to try to get a new feeling out of moving around, to varying degrees of success in my opinion.  The music video credits was added as a nod to traditional music videos.
			<br /><br />

			<b>Changelog:</b><br />
			v2<br />
			&nbsp;- Added disco balls that rotate spotlights around.  A few also move through the world.<br />
			&nbsp;- Added a moving cube field in the background of one of the cube sections.<br />
			&nbsp;- Altered the ambient light to be darker.<br />
			&nbsp;- Added music video credits to the beginning and ending.
			<br /><br />

			<b>Credits:</b><br />
			Music: "Ala Mode" - Mindless Self Indulgence<br />
			Ice Cream Enemies: Klukeart<br />
			Explosion: <i>Metal Storm</i> (NES, 1991)<br />
